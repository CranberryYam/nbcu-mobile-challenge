## Basic Idea
Sever Render: Customers can get the latest survey without updating the app in the app store.

## Workflow
1.The ios App loads the json file from the internet
The json file descripes the informations of all questions, such as which ViewController to present the question

2.Send answers to the backend
The plan generating functions are run in the backend. The app is responsible for rendering the json file to different AnswerControllers. 

## UI


## Apology
Because I have a deadline to meet for my current job, I only finish part of the app. I feel really sorry about it.
